<ul>
<li> I've recently started coding. I'm still not good at it, but don't worry ! I'll do better ! </li>
<li> Since I began this adventure, I'm making my own websites. Still under development for now ! </li>
<li> I'm currently learning JavaScript. </li>
<li> That is obviously not related to anything above, but I design and sew my own historical costumes. </li>

Thank you for reading me and wishing you an excelent day !
